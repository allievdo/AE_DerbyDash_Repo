Things added 9/11/2023 - 9/18/2023:
Created race and home scene, added dialogue, created a button that took you to the race scene and a button that returned you back to home. Player movement was also added along with a speed boost.

Things added 9/18/2023 - 2/25/2023:
Added other racers to the race scene, set their speed to a random number, once dialogue ended in the home scene, it would take you to the race scene. I also added a countdown timer before the race starts. If the player hit the finish line first, they would win and they would obtain 50 dollars. If the player didn't cross the finish line first, they would lose, and they would not make any money. If you won, a win screen will pop up with a button to go back to the home menu. If you lost, a lose screen will appear with a button to go back to the home menu.

Things added 9/25/2023 - 10/02/2023:
Created a stable scene and added a pause menu. Earnings after a race carry over to the home scene and every time you win a race, more money is added. Speed boost only holds for a certain amount of seconds, you can no longer continuously speed through the race. Dialogue now continues playing even after changing the scene.

Things added 10/02/2023 - 10/09/2023:
Added a shop scene in the stable scene. I also added another scene where you can now select a difficulty for the races: medium or easy. If you enter a race and and come back to the home screen, the dialogue should change (issue is, the continue button no longer works - will attempt to fix for next week). In the shop scene, you can click on an option and it will take money from you inventory.

Things added 10/09/2023 - 10/16/2023
You can buy up to three carrots in the shop now and use the carrots during the race for a speed boost (this isn't working properly yet. Fix for next week). A painted background was also added to the home scene. 

Things added 10/16/2023 - 10/24/2023
The number of carrots you have counts down when you use one. Your horse is now shown in the main menu and she neighs when clicked on. I also drew a race background that appears during the races.

Things added 10/24/2023 - 10/31/2023
I added horse aniamtions of various colors for the race scene and made the aniamtion play faster for the player depending on whether or not a speed boost was used.
