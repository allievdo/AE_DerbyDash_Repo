Things added 9/11/2023 - 9/18/2023:
Created race and home scene, added dialogue, created a button that took you to the race scene and a button that returned you back to home. Player movement was also added along with a speed boost.

Things added 9/18/2023 - 2/25/2023:
Added other racers to the race scene, set their speed to a random number, once dialogue ended in the home scene, it would take you to the race scene. I also added a countdown timer before the race starts. If the player hit the finish line first, they would win and they would obtain 50 dollars. If the player didn't cross the finish line first, they would lose, and they would not make any money. If you won, a win screen will pop up with a button to go back to the home menu. If you lost, a lose screen will appear with a button to go back to the home menu.

Things added 9/25/2023 - 10/02/2023:
Created a stable scene and added a pause menu. Earnings after a race carry over to the home scene and every time you win a race, more money is added. Speed boost only holds for a certain amount of seconds, you can no longer continuously speed through the race. Dialogue now continues playing even after changing the scene.
