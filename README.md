Things added 9/11/2023 - 9/18/2023:
Created race and home scene, added dialogue, created a button that took you to the race scene and a button that returned you back to home. Player movement was also added along with a speed boost.

Things added 9/18/2023 - 2/25/2023:
Added other racers to the race scene, set their speed to a random number, once dialogue ended in the home scene, it would take you to the race scene. I also added a countdown timer before the race starts. If the player hit the finish line first, they would win and they would obtain 50 dollars. If the player didn't cross the finish line first, they would lose, and they would not make any money. If you won, a win screen will pop up with a button to go back to the home menu. If you lost, a lose screen will appear with a button to go back to the home menu.

Things added 9/25/2023 - 10/02/2023:
Created a stable scene and added a pause menu. Earnings after a race carry over to the home scene and every time you win a race, more money is added. Speed boost only holds for a certain amount of seconds, you can no longer continuously speed through the race. Dialogue now continues playing even after changing the scene.

Things added 10/02/2023 - 10/09/2023:
Added a shop scene in the stable scene. I also added another scene where you can now select a difficulty for the races: medium or easy. If you enter a race and and come back to the home screen, the dialogue should change (issue is, the continue button no longer works - will attempt to fix for next week). In the shop scene, you can click on an option and it will take money from you inventory.

Things added 10/09/2023 - 10/16/2023
You can buy up to three carrots in the shop now and use the carrots during the race for a speed boost (this isn't working properly yet. Fix for next week). A painted background was also added to the home scene. 

Things added 10/16/2023 - 10/24/2023
The number of carrots you have counts down when you use one. Your horse is now shown in the main menu and she neighs when clicked on. I also drew a race background that appears during the races.

Things added 10/24/2023 - 10/31/2023
I added horse aniamtions of various colors for the race scene and made the aniamtion play faster for the player depending on whether or not a speed boost was used.

Things added 10/31/2023 - 11/07/2023
Added a dollar sign in front of the money so you know what that number represents. Retyped race instructions in the race scene. Added a win and lose screen and added a background for the race selection scene. The dialogue changes after the first race and the buttons become available after your first race. I also added more dialogue for your cousin before the first race begins. Your cousin also gives you two carrots at the beginning of the game, since the shop is not yet available. You can no longer go into debt when purchasing carrots. When you win a race at medium difficulty, you now earn 70 dollars instead of 50. You can now click anywhere in the dialogue box to continue.

Things added 11/07/2023 - 11/13/2023
As a player, I added a dollar sign to the amount of carrots in the shop scene so that people are able to tell what that "30" means. As a player, I was tired of looking at a blue screen for the shop, so I also added a background for the shop. I temporarily disabled the stable scene and changed the dialogue for your cousin since she previously stated that she was going to wait in the stable that's no longer there. I added sound to your horse when you race so there are now hoofbeats during races that pauses when you win or pause the game. As a person who knows almost nothing about composing music, I composed music for the home scene as well and added bird sound effects to bring the scene more to life. 

Things 11/13/20232 - 11/20/2023
As a player, I added a harder level, so that I feel accomplished for finishing the medium level. You can no longer sprint at the start, you have to press D first before you do anything else. As a person who wants more to the game, I added apples to the game, so that the shop has more of a variety and so that there are more power ups in the game. Apples make it so that you have a longer speed boost, so you can only buy one at a time. I also fixed the sound of the horses' gallop so that enemy horses now make a sound when they run.

Things added 11/20/2023 - 11/29/2023
As a player, I added an indicator for how many apples and carrots you can buy, so that I am not confused when I can't buy anymore of those items even with enough money. As a player, I wanted some of the buttons to fit the theme of the game, so that I am more immersed in the game's environment. I fixed the UI in the shop to properly display how many carrots or apples you have. I also played around with colliders of your horse, so that you don't win money when you lose. I also changed some mispellings in the dialogue. As a player, I want to earn some money after I lose, so I made it so that you earn ten dollars even when you lose. As a player, I want to earn more money when completing races, so that I have more to spend on shop items.

11/29/2023 - 12/09/2023:
I created a new scene that appears after you complete the hard race. I added new dialogue to that scene as well. I also drew and added your cousin, so shse now pops up when she is speaking instead of just a dialogue text box. I added a gunshot sound effect when races start now as well. I also fixed some of the horse colliders again so hopefully it won't give you the win amount of money when you lose anymore.
